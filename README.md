## 🧠 Cursor AI Usage Documentation

This project was developed using **Cursor AI**, leveraging its prompt-based development and code iteration capabilities.


### 💬 Interesting Prompts Used

- **"Generate a responsive and accessible HTML layout for a personal expense tracker with a summary section, filters, and a table for displaying transactions."**  
  → Helped design a well-structured and semantic HTML foundation with sections for summary, filters, and data table.

- **"Write JavaScript logic to manage expense records in localStorage, including add, edit, delete, and persistence across sessions."**  
  → Provided a base structure for handling CRUD operations while maintaining data integrity and browser persistence.

- **"Implement form validation ensuring positive amounts, valid dates, and preventing future dates, with user-friendly error messages."**  
  → Guided the creation of validation helpers and error handling integrated with live feedback in the form.

- **"Render category-wise spending statistics and visualize them using Chart.js, handling cases when no data is available."**  
  → Assisted in implementing dynamic category aggregation with an adaptive chart and an empty-state fallback message.

- **"Add monthly summary cards showing total spending per month with a delete button to remove all expenses for a specific month."**  
  → Helped structure the monthly grouping logic and deletion feature using date-based keys.

- **"Create a feature to export expense data as a CSV file, with an option to export only filtered records when Shift key is pressed."**  
  → Generated the base export logic, which was refined to support both full and filtered dataset exports dynamically.


## 🧩 How Cursor Helped

- Accelerated UI building by suggesting **semantic HTML** and **CSS grid layouts**  
- Simplified **localStorage integration** and **JSON parsing logic**  
- Provided **real-time debugging** when validation or rendering issues occurred  
- Recommended **ARIA roles** and **accessibility tags**  
- Assisted in improving **responsive design**


## 🔧 Modifications Made to AI-Generated Code

- Rewrote **storage handling** for better error resilience  
- Refined **UI layout** for mobile-first responsiveness  
- Added **toast notifications** for user feedback  
- Optimized **chart rendering** to show “No data available” placeholder  
- Implemented **delete by month** functionality and **Shift+Export CSV**


##  Challenges Faced & How They Were Solved

| Challenge                                          | Solution                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data not updating dynamically after adding expense | Refactored render logic and ensured table + summary re-rendered after each operation |
| Duplicate category names with inconsistent casing | Added category normalization to Title Case                                           |
| Validation errors showing inconsistently           | Added centralized error handling with live updates                                   |
| Empty chart state causing visual bugs              | Added fallback text “No category data”                                               |
| Filter reset not updating summary                  | Linked filters with real-time refresh calls                                          |
