## üß† Cursor AI Usage Documentation

This project was developed using **Cursor AI**, leveraging its prompt-based development and code iteration capabilities.


### üí¨ Interesting Prompts Used

- **"Generate a responsive and accessible HTML layout for a personal expense tracker with a summary section, filters, and a table for displaying transactions."**  
  ‚Üí Helped design a well-structured and semantic HTML foundation with sections for summary, filters, and data table.

- **"Write JavaScript logic to manage expense records in localStorage, including add, edit, delete, and persistence across sessions."**  
  ‚Üí Provided a base structure for handling CRUD operations while maintaining data integrity and browser persistence.

- **"Implement form validation ensuring positive amounts, valid dates, and preventing future dates, with user-friendly error messages."**  
  ‚Üí Guided the creation of validation helpers and error handling integrated with live feedback in the form.

- **"Render category-wise spending statistics and visualize them using Chart.js, handling cases when no data is available."**  
  ‚Üí Assisted in implementing dynamic category aggregation with an adaptive chart and an empty-state fallback message.

- **"Add monthly summary cards showing total spending per month with a delete button to remove all expenses for a specific month."**  
  ‚Üí Helped structure the monthly grouping logic and deletion feature using date-based keys.

- **"Create a feature to export expense data as a CSV file, with an option to export only filtered records when Shift key is pressed."**  
  ‚Üí Generated the base export logic, which was refined to support both full and filtered dataset exports dynamically.


## üß© How Cursor Helped

- Simplified **localStorage integration** and **JSON parsing logic**  
- Provided **real-time debugging** when validation or rendering issues occurred  
- Recommended **ARIA roles** and **accessibility tags**  
- Assisted in improving **responsive design**


## üîß Modifications Made to AI-Generated Code

- Rewrote **storage handling** for better error resilience  
- Refined **UI layout** for mobile-first responsiveness  
- Added **toast notifications** for user feedback
